Changelog for package ros_mscl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forthcoming
-----------
* Fix missing dependencies that are breaking the buildfarm
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

1.1.2 (2021-02-09)
------------------
* Move the libmscl dependency to a normal depend, as it's required for both building & running
* Remove the examples folder, move the ros_mscl contents into the root of the repo. Update the package data to remove the broken dependency (until we can get it fixed). Update authors & maintainer for this fork.
* Fixed bug preventing device report service from working on a GQ7.
* Added support for raw binary file output and RTK status message (see changelog for details)
* Added PPS Source, GPIO Config, and external GPS time updating
* Added feature checking for filter reset and imu category
* Fixed driver error that tried to publish magnetometer data when it is not present
* 1) Added device Idle prior to shutdown to play nice across host power cycles
  2) Fixed flags used to determine valid time for GNSS time message
* Fixed time reference output to use ROS time for header timestamp
* sensor_msgs::TimeReference added per user request
* Added a resume command at the end of device setup as the GQ7 needs it.
* 1) Changed GQ7 filter init alignment selector to a bitfield in the example launch file
  2) Fixed quaternion sensor2vehicle frame rotation (negated the indices instead of the values by accident)
* See changelog for full details.
